To run the example function app locally from VSCode, make sure to install the Azure Functions and Azurite extensions. 
Then start Azurite via the `Azurite: Start` VSCode task.

Build the library `npm run build` or use `npm run watch` to hotdeploy changes.

Start the function app by running the VScode launch configuration "Attach to Node Functions".
